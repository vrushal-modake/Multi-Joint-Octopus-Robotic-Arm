# 🐙 Multi-Joint “Octopus” Robotic Arm (Ongoing)

## 🎯 Objective
Design a robotic arm inspired by the flexibility and control of an octopus tentacle. The arm is built with multiple joints and designed for motion in both **2D and 3D** space.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-joint simulation in 2D space (3D coming soon)
- Modular design for forward/inverse kinematics
- ROS-ready structure for future deployment
- Servo control design for physical arm prototype

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Matplotlib (for simulation)
- ROS (planned)
- Arduino (hardware phase)
- STL/CAD files (planned)

## 📁 Project Structure
```bash
